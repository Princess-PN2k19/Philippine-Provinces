This historic city is one of the most popular jumping off-points in all of the Philippines for foreign visitors, with the busiest sea port in the Philippines and the second largest air hub. Ferdinand Magellan died here planting the cross almost 500 years ago bringing Spanish influence and establishing Asia's first European settlement. Cebu was also once a bustling commercial hub between Mexico and China. Today, there is a widespread youthful optimism throughout this thriving energetic metropolis. For the past decade, ever increasing foreign investment has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in countless call centers and factories. Rapid economic growth has also spawned the emergence of a modern urban skyline and the development of a widening middle class. The tourism trade is also booming, particularly from Australia, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and China. It's no surprise TripAdvisor named Cebu island in the Top 25 list for best holiday destinations in Asia for 2019, the only Philippine destination to make the list. Cebu City might just be the best front row seat to witness the Philippines transform from a low to middle income country.","rating":2.75}
